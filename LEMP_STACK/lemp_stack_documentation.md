# LEMP Stack Implementation in AWS

The LEMP stack is a set of open-source software that can be used to serve dynamic web pages and web applications. LEMP stands for Linux, Nginx (pronounced "Engine-X"), MySQL, and PHP. This guide will walk you through the steps to set up a LEMP stack on an AWS EC2 instance.

## Step 0: Preparing Prerequisites  
**1. Launch an  EC2 Instance of t3.micro type and Ubuntu 24.04 LTS (HVM) using the AWS console.**

 **2. The security group was configured with the following inbound rules:**

* Allow traffic on port 80 (HTTP) with source from anywhere on the internet.
* Allow traffic on port 443 (HTTPS) with source from anywhere on the internet.
* Allow traffic on port 22 (SSH) with source from any IP address. This is opened by default.

**3. The default VPC and Subnet was used for the networking configuration.**

**4. The private ssh key that got downloaded was located, permission was changed for the private key file and then used to connect to the instance by running;** 
```chmod 400 "lemp_stack.pem"```   

```ssh -i "lemp_stack.pem" ubuntu@ec2-13-60-25-27.eu-north-1.compute.amazonaws.com```

**1.  To verify that nginx was successfully installed and is running as a service in Ubuntu, run;**    
  
`sudo systemctl status nginx`    

If it's green and running, then nginx is correctly installed

Our server is running and we can access it locally and from the internet.

*To access it locally in our Ubuntu shell, run; 

`curl http://localhost:80` or
` curl http://13.60.25.27:80`

*To access it from the internet, Open a web browser of your choice and try to access the url;
`http://<Public-IP-Address>:80`

## Step 2 - Install MySQL  

**1. Install a relational database (RDB)**

MySQL was installed in this project. It is a popular relational database management system used within PHP environments.

```sudo apt install mysql-server```
